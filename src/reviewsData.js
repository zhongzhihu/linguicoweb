    title: "Great app!: very helpful and straight forward",
    text: "This is actually a really helpful application for a few reasons! And specifically for me as someone who doesn‚Äôt speak German, but has an interest in learning it, that it seems like there are patterns and similarities between English and German that should be easy to get, but it‚Äôs still very hard for me. I like how this really does lay it out there plain and simple, and in a way that actually does stick. This is the way I learn best. Thanks!!",

    text: "I‚Äôve been scouring ways to learn German vocabulary without all the nonsense of upselling paid services. I‚Äôve been practicing grammar to improve my conversation with German relatives, who are constantly correcting the gender articles. It‚Äôs been a godsend finding an app that lets me practice just that! Drilling the der, die, das is something I can now do in my downtime between meetings or on-the-go! The voice readout is also quite clear-sounding.",

    text: "The best flashcards for learning German vocabulary and of much better quality than those in an Anki deck. Since the flashcards are ordered by frequency, you will only learn relevant German words. The der, die, das exercise with hints is really useful. The grammar summaries on prepositions are great and easy to read during my commute.",
